# CRM Front-End-Only Prototype

This is the first prototype of a lightweight customer relations management app. I am interested in targeting recent coding bootcamp grads who need to keep track of contacts in their job search. In addition, my wife says that lawyers need such a thing as well.

Eventually, this project will have a backend and will be mostly a mobile-app. It will probably require React Native (although I can be convinced otherwise), GraphQL (Don't try to convince me otherwise), and a database. Give me guidance whether I should use MongoDB, FaunaDB, or PostgreSQL.

I also want to create a coach view where an overview of mutliple jobseekers can be seen at once. Also, perhaps an admin view for user management.

For now, the back end is mocked out using Vuex.
